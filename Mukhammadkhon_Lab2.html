      n select the ID we mentioned in DIv of HTML n then through .innerHTML we display that output message on the browser. So DOM manipulation is pretty useful-->

         fly today whereas, in the next part we use else so if it doesn't work with the first statement then display that 405 passengers will fly and 16 passengers
